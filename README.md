# Number-Guessing-Game
Hello , this small bedinner and intermidate project .Build a game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it. The program will give hints like "too high" or "too low."



The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
The user is prompted to guess the number.
After each guess, the program provides feedback: whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
The program also counts and displays the number of attempts the user made.
